3. source code
4. time to describe code's purpose


In the next phase of this study, you will be presented with the first piece of source code. 
Please read the source code carefully in order to understand what it does. 
After reading, you will be asked to describe the code's purpose.

When done reading the source code, you can use any key on the keyboard to continue. 
You can then write your interpretation of the code's purpose down on the form that was handed to you.
